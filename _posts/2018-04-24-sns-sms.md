As software developers we sometimes end up doing really long-winded things such as migrating databases or re-compiling large projects. We often 'fire-and-forget', going off to do some other task while our process finishes.

Typically, we then repeatedly interrupt ourselves to check back on the task, or just completely forget about it until long after it's complete.

Some enterprising developers use `sendmail` to send themselves an email when their process completes. It looks something like:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "super long build complete!" | sendmail -v you@yourdomain.com
{% endhighlight %}

But `sendmail` requires some non-trivial configuration to get working, and you may only be getting emails on the machine you're working on anyway. Wouldn't it be nice to get a reminder on your phone?

With AWS SNS, you can do just that, thanks to SNS' remarkable ability to send messages over SMS. Here's what you need:

1. Access to an AWS account
2. The [AWS CLI][aws-cli]
3. IAM role that can perform `sns:Publish`

Once you have all that, sending a text message with SNS is as simple as:

{% highlight bash %}
aws --profile $YOUR_IAM_ROLE publish --phone-number $YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER --message "Task done! Yay!"
{% endhighlight %}

You can scriptify this:

lmk.sh:
{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
phone_number="$1"
aws --profile $YOUR_IAM_ROLE publish --phone-number $phone_number --message "Task done! Yay!"
{% endhighlight %}

And use:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "a super long build..." | ./lmk.sh $YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER
{% endhighlight %}

Easy!

You can now concentrate on whatever task you moved on to and know that when your build/migration/whatever is done you'll get a nice little reminder on your phone.
